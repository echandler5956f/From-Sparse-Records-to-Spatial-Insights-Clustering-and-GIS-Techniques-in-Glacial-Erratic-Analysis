\section{Reflection on Original Objectives and \\ Project Completion}
\label{sec:objective_reflection}

This interdisciplinary research project set out to address fundamental challenges in preserving and presenting the scattered knowledge about North American named glacial erratics—remarkable landscape features that exist at the intersection of geological science and cultural meaning-making. The successful development and implementation of our digital heritage platform demonstrates how computational tools can bridge scientific and humanistic approaches to landscape interpretation while serving diverse public communities through accessible, responsive web interfaces.

\subsection{Assessment of Primary Objectives}
\label{subsec:objective_assessment}

The platform's implementation provides clear evidence of success across all three primary objectives established in the project's introduction, with measurable outcomes that validate the interdisciplinary approach adopted throughout this research.

\textbf{Objective 1: Comprehensive Digital Heritage Platform Development.} The platform successfully consolidates scattered information about named glacial erratics into a unified, publicly accessible interface that demonstrates sophisticated integration of complex spatial and cultural data. The implementation of over fifteen filter types across geological, cultural, and accessibility criteria provides users with unprecedented ability to explore erratics based on diverse interests and practical constraints. The real-time filtering system's millisecond response times for continental-scale spatial queries validates the platform's technical robustness, while the integration of detailed popup information for individual erratics demonstrates effective information architecture for complex interdisciplinary content. The successful representation of diverse erratic types—from contested heritage sites like Plymouth Rock to Indigenous sacred places like Okotoks Big Rock to distributed collections like Babson's Boulders—proves the platform's ability to accommodate complex cultural objects within standardized digital systems without compromising their individual significance.

\textbf{Objective 2: Interdisciplinary Computational Methods for Public Engagement.} The platform demonstrates how advanced computational capabilities can enhance rather than replace traditional approaches to cultural landscape exploration, successfully serving both scientific inquiry and public accessibility goals. The implementation of Traveling Salesman Problem route optimization transforms static heritage information into dynamic tourism planning tools, enabling users to generate practical visiting routes that connect scientific education with cultural appreciation. The integration of geodesically accurate Haversine distance calculations with user-friendly interface design proves that mathematical precision and public accessibility can coexist effectively. Most significantly, the platform's treatment of Indigenous knowledge—prominently presenting creation narratives alongside geological information for sites like Okotoks and \emph{Tomanowos}—demonstrates how digital platforms can honor multiple knowledge systems without forcing hierarchical relationships between scientific and cultural perspectives.

\textbf{Objective 3: Robust Framework for Future Collaborative Research.} The platform's modular architecture, built using React.js frontend, Node.js/Express backend, and PostgreSQL with PostGIS extensions, establishes a replicable technical framework that can accommodate future expansion while maintaining core functionality. The successful integration of diverse data types—geological characteristics, cultural narratives, accessibility information, spatial coordinates—within unified database structures demonstrates scalable approaches to interdisciplinary data management. The platform's ability to serve multiple user communities simultaneously—heritage tourists, educators, researchers, local stakeholders—through the same technical infrastructure validates the framework's flexibility for supporting diverse scholarly and public engagement applications.

The platform's approach to presenting Indigenous knowledge alongside geological information provides important precedents for digital projects working with culturally sensitive materials. The prominent presentation of Indigenous names, creation narratives, and cultural protocols for sites like Okotoks Big Rock and the Willamette Meteorite demonstrates how digital humanities can advance inclusive scholarship that honors multiple knowledge systems.

\subsection{Interdisciplinary Research Methodology}
\label{subsec:interdisciplinary_methodology}

The project's successful integration of geological science with cultural heritage preservation demonstrates effective strategies for bridging STEM and humanities approaches within unified research frameworks. The platform's technical implementation—spatial database design, geographic analysis capabilities, interactive mapping interfaces—serves cultural interpretation and public engagement goals, proving that computational methods can enhance humanistic inquiry without reducing its complexity.

The platform development process itself provides insights into effective interdisciplinary collaboration, demonstrating how technical design decisions—data modeling choices, user interface architecture, content presentation strategies—can either support or hinder the respectful integration of different disciplinary perspectives. The successful accommodation of both geological precision and cultural sensitivity within the same digital system establishes precedents for future interdisciplinary projects that require similar integration challenges.

\section{Honest Assessment of Current Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations_assessment}

While the platform successfully achieves its primary objectives and demonstrates significant contributions to digital heritage practice, honest assessment reveals several important limitations that provide opportunities for future development and refinement. Acknowledging these constraints enables more effective planning for platform evolution and provides realistic expectations for similar interdisciplinary projects.

\subsection{Current Platform Constraints}
\label{subsec:platform_constraints}

The platform's current geographic scope focuses exclusively on North American erratics, reflecting both the project's origins and practical constraints on data collection and verification. While this regional focus enables detailed treatment of representative examples like those examined in the case studies, it limits the platform's utility for global comparative analysis or international heritage tourism applications. The database structure and technical architecture can accommodate expansion beyond North America, but such growth would require substantial additional research and data collection efforts.

The platform currently operates with an English-only interface, limiting accessibility for diverse linguistic communities that may have significant connections to featured erratics. This constraint is particularly significant given the platform's emphasis on respectful Indigenous knowledge integration—many of the cultural narratives and place names presented could benefit from multilingual representation that honors original languages alongside English translations.

Data quality and completeness vary significantly across different erratics, reflecting the heterogeneous nature of available historical documentation, archaeological research, and contemporary cultural knowledge. While the platform's design accommodates this variation through flexible content structures, some erratics necessarily receive more comprehensive treatment than others based on available source materials rather than their intrinsic significance.

\subsection{Methodological and Representational Limitations}
\label{subsec:methodological_limitations}

The platform's emphasis on standardized digital representation, while enabling consistent user experience and comparative analysis, necessarily involves trade-offs between individual complexity and systematic accessibility. Some aspects of erratic significance—particularly subtle cultural protocols, seasonal ceremonial practices, or experiential knowledge that emerges through direct landscape engagement—resist straightforward digital translation and may be inadequately represented through current interface designs.

The platform's focus on heritage tourism applications, while serving important public engagement goals, may inadvertently emphasize certain types of erratic significance (accessibility, visual impact, historical narratives) over others (spiritual privacy, ecological relationships, community-specific knowledge). This bias reflects practical design decisions rather than explicit value judgments, but it shapes how users encounter and interpret erratic information.

The current implementation relies on remote institutional curation rather than community-controlled content management, potentially limiting the platform's responsiveness to evolving cultural perspectives or emerging research findings. While the platform includes Indigenous knowledge respectfully, it does not yet provide mechanisms for ongoing community contributions or updates that would enable dynamic knowledge evolution.

\subsection{Technical and Accessibility Considerations}
\label{subsec:technical_limitations}

The platform's current architecture assumes reliable internet connectivity and standard web browser capabilities, potentially limiting accessibility for users in areas with limited internet infrastructure or older computing equipment. While the responsive design adapts across different screen sizes, the platform has not yet been optimized for offline functionality that might support field-based heritage tourism in areas with poor connectivity.

The platform's spatial analysis capabilities, while sophisticated for public engagement applications, operate at relatively coarse scales that may not accommodate specialized research requiring high-precision coordinate data or detailed geological analysis. The current implementation prioritizes user-friendly approximations over research-grade precision, reflecting design decisions that serve public accessibility goals but may limit certain scholarly applications.

The filtering system, while comprehensive across implemented criteria, necessarily reflects the data categories and relationships present in current database structures. Future expansion of filtering capabilities would require both technical development and careful consideration of how additional data categories might affect user experience and interface complexity.

These limitations do not diminish the platform's current achievements but rather provide realistic foundations for future development priorities and realistic expectations for similar interdisciplinary digital heritage projects. The successful implementation despite these constraints demonstrates the value of acknowledging limitations while pursuing ambitious interdisciplinary goals.

It concludes with a functioning digital heritage platform that transforms how we think about the intersection of geological science, cultural meaning-making, and public engagement. The success lies not merely in technical implementation, but in demonstrating that sophisticated computational methods can honor both scientific precision and cultural complexity while serving diverse communities.

\subsection{Core Achievement: Integration Without Compromise}
\label{subsec:core_achievement}

The platform proves that interdisciplinary research need not require choosing between scientific rigor and cultural sensitivity, between technical sophistication and public accessibility, or between academic goals and community needs. Real-time spatial analysis coexists with respectful Indigenous knowledge presentation. Route optimization algorithms serve heritage tourism while maintaining accuracy about sacred sites. Standardized digital systems accommodate contested heritage sites like Plymouth Rock alongside monumental landmarks like Okotoks Big Rock without diminishing either's significance.

This integration achievement establishes a replicable framework for digital humanities projects that seek to bridge disciplinary boundaries while serving multiple audiences. The methodology—from case study analysis through technical implementation to public interface design—provides concrete guidance for similar interdisciplinary initiatives.

\subsection{Lasting Contributions: Beyond Glacial Erratics}
\label{subsec:lasting_contributions}

The platform's broader significance extends across three domains. \textbf{Methodologically}, it demonstrates how digital heritage projects can handle temporal complexity, spatial change, and interpretive controversy without reducing them to technical problems requiring algorithmic solutions. \textbf{Practically}, it establishes precedents for heritage tourism applications that transform academic research into actionable public tools while respecting cultural protocols. \textbf{Conceptually}, it validates approaches to university research that prioritize public engagement and community collaboration alongside scholarly advancement.

The route optimization innovation alone represents a novel contribution to digital heritage design—proving that computational algorithms traditionally used for logistics can be adapted to serve cultural preservation goals. This technical creativity in service of humanistic objectives suggests broader possibilities for how digital humanities can advance both scholarly understanding and public engagement.

\subsection{Framework for the Future}
\label{subsec:framework_future}

Perhaps most importantly, this project demonstrates that digital technologies can foster sustainable relationships between human communities and significant landscape features rather than abstracting them into datasets. The platform serves as infrastructure for ongoing collaboration between geological scientists, cultural communities, heritage professionals, and public audiences—each bringing distinct perspectives that enrich understanding of how ice age processes created foundations for subsequent human meaning-making.

The modular technical architecture enables adaptation to other heritage contexts while maintaining core principles of respectful knowledge integration and community accessibility. More significantly, the project validates interdisciplinary approaches that advance both scholarly inquiry and community empowerment through collaborative heritage stewardship.

The remarkable glacial erratics scattered across North America continue to embody the complex relationships between geological processes and cultural meaning-making that first inspired this research.
