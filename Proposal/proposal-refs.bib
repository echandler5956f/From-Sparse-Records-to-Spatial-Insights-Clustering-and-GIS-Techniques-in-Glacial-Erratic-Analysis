@article{Clark2018,
   abstract = {<p> During the last glaciation, most of the British Isles and the surrounding continental shelf were covered by the British–Irish Ice Sheet ( <styled-content style="fixed-case">BIIS</styled-content> ). An earlier compilation from the existing literature ( <styled-content style="fixed-case">BRITICE</styled-content> version 1) assembled the relevant glacial geomorphological evidence into a freely available <styled-content style="fixed-case">GIS</styled-content> geodatabase and map (Clark <italic>et al</italic> . 2004: <italic>Boreas</italic> 33, 359). New high‐resolution digital elevation models, of the land and seabed, have become available casting the glacial landform record of the British Isles in a new light and highlighting the shortcomings of the V.1 <styled-content style="fixed-case">BRITICE</styled-content> compilation. Here we present a wholesale revision of the evidence, onshore and offshore, to produce <styled-content style="fixed-case">BRITICE</styled-content> version 2, which now also includes Ireland. All published geomorphological evidence pertinent to the behaviour of the ice sheet is included, up to the census date of December 2015. The revised <styled-content style="fixed-case">GIS</styled-content> database contains over 170 000 geospatially referenced and attributed elements – an eightfold increase in information from the previous version. The compiled data include: drumlins, ribbed moraine, crag‐and‐tails, mega‐scale glacial lineations, glacially streamlined bedrock (grooves, roches moutonnées, whalebacks), glacial erratics, eskers, meltwater channels (subglacial, lateral, proglacial and tunnel valleys), moraines, trimlines, cirques, trough‐mouth fans and evidence defining ice‐dammed lakes. The increased volume of features necessitates different map/database products with varying levels of data generalization, namely: (i) an unfiltered <styled-content style="fixed-case">GIS</styled-content> database containing all mapping; (ii) a filtered <styled-content style="fixed-case">GIS</styled-content> database, resolving data conflicts and with edits to improve geo‐locational accuracy (available as <styled-content style="fixed-case">GIS</styled-content> data and <styled-content style="fixed-case">PDF</styled-content> maps); and (iii) a cartographically generalized map to provide an overview of the distribution and types of features at the ice‐sheet scale that can be printed at A0 paper size at a 1:1 250 000 scale. All <styled-content style="fixed-case">GIS</styled-content> data, the maps (as PDFs) and a bibliography of all published sources are available for download from: <ext-link href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/geography/staff/clark_chris/britice">https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/geography/staff/clark_chris/britice</ext-link> . </p>},
