Glacial erratics, boulders transported by ice sheets, serve as significant geological markers and potent cultural landmarks across North America. However, systematically analyzing their distribution and significance is challenged by the sparse, heterogeneous, and often qualitative nature of historical and geological records. This paper presents an integrated computational methodology designed to derive spatial and thematic insights from these complex datasets. We combine Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques for managing spatial data and calculating proximity metrics (e.g., Haversine distance) with advanced spatial analysis, including density-based clustering (DBSCAN), to identify patterns in erratic distributions. Crucially, we integrate Natural Language Processing (NLP), employing Sentence Transformer embeddings and topic modeling strategies (conceptually based on BERTopic and Latent Dirichlet Allocation - LDA), to extract semantic meaning and thematic structures from associated textual descriptions. We detail the theoretical underpinnings of this pipeline and illustrate its capacity to address specific domain challenges—such as positional ambiguity from historical movement, classification complexity, extreme scale variations, and data sparsity—through in-depth case studies of nine notable North American erratics. This work offers a robust framework for synthesizing diverse data sources, enabling deeper spatial-textual understanding of landscape features characterized by fragmented and challenging records.

%	EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{execSummary}
\addchaptertocentry{\execname}
Glacial erratics – large boulders transported by ancient ice sheets – are significant features across North America, holding clues about past environments and often carrying deep cultural and historical importance. However, understanding their broader patterns and significance is hindered by the nature of the data available: records are often sparse, inconsistent, spread across different sources, and mix geographic locations with historical anecdotes and cultural narratives. Effectively analyzing such fragmented information requires new approaches.

This paper introduces and details a novel computational methodology designed specifically to tackle these challenges. We have developed an integrated system that combines geospatial techniques (mapping, distance calculations) with advanced computational text analysis (Natural Language Processing, or NLP). This allows us to simultaneously analyze the geographic distribution of erratics, identifying spatial clusters and relationships using methods like DBSCAN clustering, while also automatically uncovering key themes and meanings (such as cultural significance, geological descriptions, or historical uses) hidden within the associated textual records using topic modeling and semantic analysis.

The paper explains the theoretical basis of this combined spatial-textual approach and demonstrates its effectiveness through case studies of nine particularly challenging erratics across North America. These examples show how the methodology can handle common problems like rocks that were moved historically, features of vastly different scales, and objects with complex classifications (like a meteorite transported by glaciers).

Ultimately, this research provides a powerful new toolkit for researchers. By systematically integrating sparse spatial and textual data, our methodology enables deeper insights into the geological context, historical relevance, and cultural significance of glacial erratics and similar landscape features characterized by complex and incomplete records. The approach has broader applicability for studies in historical geography, digital humanities, and cultural heritage that grapple with integrating diverse, fragmented data sources.
