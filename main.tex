Glacial erratics—boulders transported by ice sheets and deposited across North America—represent remarkable landscape features that exist at the intersection of geological science and cultural meaning-making. Despite their significance as both natural phenomena and cultural landmarks, information about named erratics remains scattered across diverse sources, creating barriers to public engagement and scholarly research. This paper presents the development and implementation of an interdisciplinary digital heritage platform that consolidates this fragmented knowledge into a unified, publicly accessible web application serving heritage tourists, educators, researchers, and local communities. The platform employs modern web technologies—React.js frontend, Node.js/Express backend, and PostgreSQL with PostGIS spatial extensions—to provide real-time filtering capabilities, interactive mapping, and route optimization functionality that transforms static heritage information into practical tourism planning tools. Through detailed examination of nine diverse case studies ranging from contested heritage sites like Plymouth Rock to Indigenous sacred places like Okotoks Big Rock, we demonstrate how standardized digital systems can accommodate complex cultural objects while maintaining respectful representation and scholarly accuracy. The platform's Traveling Salesman Problem route optimization, geodesically accurate distance calculations, and comprehensive filtering system enable users to discover and visit erratics based on geological characteristics, cultural significance, and accessibility requirements. This research contributes methodological insights to digital heritage practice, establishes precedents for heritage tourism applications, and validates interdisciplinary approaches that bridge geological science with cultural heritage preservation through accessible public interfaces.

\begin{execSummary}
\addchaptertocentry{\execname}
Glacial erratics—large boulders transported by ancient ice sheets—are remarkable landscape features that serve as both geological evidence of past environments and significant cultural landmarks across North America. Despite their scientific and cultural importance, information about named erratics remains scattered across diverse sources including geological reports, historical accounts, and cultural narratives, creating barriers to public discovery and appreciation of these unique heritage sites.

This paper presents the successful development and implementation of an interdisciplinary digital heritage platform that addresses these challenges by consolidating fragmented information into a unified, publicly accessible web application. Rather than focusing on analytical complexity, our approach prioritizes public engagement and heritage tourism while maintaining scholarly accuracy and cultural sensitivity.

The platform demonstrates successful integration of modern web technologies with sophisticated spatial capabilities. Built using React.js, Node.js, and PostgreSQL with PostGIS extensions, the system provides real-time filtering across geological, cultural, and accessibility criteria, enabling users to explore erratics based on diverse interests and practical constraints. A key innovation is the implementation of Traveling Salesman Problem route optimization that generates efficient visiting routes for heritage tourists, transforming static academic information into practical tourism planning tools.

Through detailed examination of nine diverse case studies—from contested heritage sites like Plymouth Rock to Indigenous sacred places like Okotoks Big Rock to artistic installations like Babson's Boulders—we demonstrate how digital heritage platforms can accommodate complex cultural objects within standardized systems while maintaining respectful representation of cultural knowledge and protocols.

The platform successfully serves multiple user communities: heritage tourists seeking practical visiting information, educators exploring geological and cultural connections, researchers investigating spatial patterns, and local stakeholders documenting landscape significance. Performance results show millisecond response times for complex spatial queries across continental-scale datasets, validating the technical architecture's ability to support responsive public interfaces and scalablity to future research efforts.

This research contributes methodological insights to digital heritage practice, establishes important precedents for heritage tourism applications, and validates interdisciplinary approaches that bridge geological science with cultural heritage preservation. The project demonstrates how thoughtful integration of spatial technology, content curation, and user experience design can create inclusive digital spaces that serve both scholarly inquiry and community needs while fostering sustainable relationships between human communities and significant landscape features.
